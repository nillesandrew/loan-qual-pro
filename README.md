# Loan-Qual Pro

This CLI utility enables our loan system to accuratly screen customer loan applications and outputs a list of qualified lenders for the customer and Loan officer to review. This program takes a active look at live data from the companys rate sheet, and screens this list for basic minimum DTI and LTI criteria. Using this program, we can speed up the prequalification process and streamline the loan pipeline.
